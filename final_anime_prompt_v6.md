Professional anime illustration with masterpiece quality and absurdres detail level for game sprite use, featuring a single girl with {HAIR: ここに髪型と髪色を入力} and {EYES: ここに目の形と色を入力} wearing {OUTFIT: ここに服装を入力} with {HEIGHT: small/medium/tall のいずれかを入力} proportions, standing in perfectly upright vertical position suitable for game character sprite with no head tilt or body lean, full body pose against a pure black background that must remain completely black without any gray tones, where these user specifications take absolute priority and must be followed exactly as written, with the character rendered in a sophisticated flat coloring style that creates depth entirely through strategic brightness gradients rather than traditional shadows, starting with the character's proportions which vary based on the HEIGHT parameter where small creates exactly 5 head tall petite figure with youthful innocent features and noticeably shorter stature maintaining cuteness without explicit childish elements, tall creates elegant 6.5 head tall proportions with elongated elegant limbs and mature sophisticated features, and medium or unspecified creates standard 5.5-6 head tall proportions with balanced teenage appearance, ensuring the figure maintains realistic anime proportions absolutely never becoming chibi or super-deformed regardless of height selection, with properly proportioned limbs where legs comprise 45% of total height for all builds, implementing absolutely mandatory comprehensive gradient-based rendering system where EVERY single element from hair to clothing to accessories MUST show dramatic 30-40% brightness variations to create dimensionality or the image is considered failed, specifically the hair must transition from 40% brightness at the roots through 55% in the mid-sections to 70% at the tips with individual strand groups varying by 10% brightness to create natural volume without any cel shading, using blue-tinted dark gray base colors like #1A1A2E or #16213E for dark hair rather than pure black to maintain the soft aesthetic, while clothing follows an absolute mandatory layering system where EVERY single piece shows brightness gradients: shirts/tops must be 95% brightness at shoulders gradually darkening to 55% at waist creating 40% variation, skirts must be 90% brightness at waistband darkening to 50% at hem for clear vertical depth, sleeves transitioning from 95% at shoulders to 60% at wrists, aprons and outer layers following same top-to-bottom gradient rules, with the frontmost complete layer at overall 95% brightness, second layer at 80%, third at 70%, fourth at 60%, and every fold/crease showing additional 20% darkening, creating clear depth hierarchy without breaking flat coloring rule, with gradient effect so prominent that viewer can immediately see the brightness variation on every piece of clothing, if any clothing appears uniformly colored the image is failed, applying this same gradient principle to ALL clothing elements not just hair, where every piece of clothing must show clear brightness gradients creating dimensional appearance purely through brightness variation, with shoes and feet showing 40% darker brightness at ground contact points transitioning smoothly upward, using regular footwear appropriate to the outfit, using the established palette of powder blue #E0F4FF, baby pink #FFE8F0, pale lavender #E6E0F0, and mint green #F0FFF8, all maintaining 90-95% brightness with only 15-25% saturation to achieve the characteristic milky washed-out appearance, ensuring that traditional black elements in clothing like maid outfits are replaced with dark blue-gray #2C3E50 while maintaining the outfit's recognizable silhouette, for casual/streetwear use full pastel palette, BUT for maid outfits keep traditional black as dark blue-gray #2C3E50 NOT pastel, whites stay cream #FFF8F0, incorporating minimum 4-5 overlapping clothing layers to create depth through brightness variation alone, each layer featuring different fabric textures indicated solely through subtle color and brightness shifts rather than texture rendering, with oversized loose-fitting silhouettes being essential for achieving the correct aesthetic, decorated with asymmetric non-functional elements with extreme intricacy: precisely drawn straps with individual adjustment holes, detailed buckles showing metallic highlights through brightness variation, ribbons with visible fabric weave patterns, decorative chains with every link defined, small printed patterns where each motif is completely drawn not simplified, tiny mascot designs with full facial features and clothing details, elaborate lace trim with every loop and connection visible, embroidered sections showing individual thread directions, multiple button types each with unique design, decorative stitching patterns following realistic sewing logic, limiting accessories to exactly 2-3 carefully chosen focal points such as small hair ornaments in coordinated pastels, a simple bag or pouch with subtle decorations, and maximum one small keychain or charm attachment, rendering the face with eyes that occupy exactly one quarter of the face height with detailed gradient irises blending 3 carefully selected pastel colors, individually drawn eyelashes with natural variation, maintaining the essential sleepy half-closed drowsy expression with a slightly vacant melancholic gaze that defines the style's emotional quality, using only a tiny dot or subtle shadow for the nose and minimal to completely absent mouth to maintain the minimalist facial features, all line art must be rendered at MAXIMUM 1 pixel thickness only with absolutely no exceptions, ultra-thin delicate lines throughout entire image, thinner than pencil sketch lines, comparable to finest technical pen 0.03mm drawings, every line must be hairline thin including main outlines, every single decorative element fully realized with precision linework including individual lace patterns, detailed embroidery stitches, every button and buttonhole clearly defined, all fabric seams visible, intricate fold lines showing fabric structure, individual hair strands drawn separately with varying flow, delicate eyelash separation, fine jewelry chain links if present, tiny pattern details fully rendered not suggested, achieving supreme technical precision comparable to professional manga illustration with meticulous attention to smallest details, lines tinted to match adjacent colors rather than using black, employing dark blue-gray #4A5568 for main structural outlines only, with smooth antialiased curves throughout maintaining razor-sharp clarity, absolutely no line simplification or shorthand allowed, every ruffle edge individually drawn, every pleat carefully delineated, every decorative stitch shown, achieving a perfectly clean vector illustration quality with supreme intricacy and craftsmanship, comparable to professional Adobe Illustrator artwork with maximum detail density, where every millimeter of the illustration contains carefully considered details, intricate patterns within patterns, subtle design elements that reward close inspection, maintaining technical excellence of commercial game art and high-end character design standards, zero texture or noise but maximum detail complexity, sharp yet soft edges with perfect anti-aliasing, ensuring every decorative element from smallest button to tiniest embroidered flower is fully realized with complete internal detail not just suggested shapes, consistent professional production quality rejecting any amateur simplification, where every button, seam, fold, and decorative element is fully realized, individual hair strands are clearly defined, and the overall composition maintains perfect centering with generous margins around the character, showing the complete figure including footwear in perfectly upright vertical stance suitable for game sprite use, with absolutely no body tilting or leaning, head held straight without tilting left or right, shoulders perfectly level and horizontal, spine completely vertical, both feet planted firmly on same horizontal plane, maintaining symmetrical balance for clean game asset extraction, only the weight distribution can favor one leg while keeping overall posture perfectly vertical, ensuring the character can be cleanly extracted as game sprite without rotation correction, in a natural relaxed pose that maintains perfect vertical alignment rather than dynamic angled poses, creating an illustration that captures the exact aesthetic of modern Japanese character designs with their characteristic combination of cute styling, melancholic undertones, and sophisticated color harmony, maintaining the delicate balance between simplicity and detail that defines this particular art style.
