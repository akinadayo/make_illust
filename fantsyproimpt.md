## カスタマイズ可能版プロンプト（日本語入力対応）

A high-quality fantasy character illustration in the style of premium Japanese mobile games, featuring a beautiful anime-style character with {髪の長さを入力} {髪色を入力} hair in {髪型を入力} style, wearing {服装を入力}. The character has {瞳の形を入力} eyes in {瞳の色を入力} color, showing {表情を入力} that captures their personality.

**The character is shown in full body standing pose against a pure black background**, displaying the entire outfit from head to toe. The character should have {頭身を選択：小さめ=youthful/petite、大きめ=tall/elegant、普通=balanced、指定なし=削除} proportions with a graceful build typical of fantasy game characters.

**頭身の詳細設定：**
- 小さめ（youthful/petite）を入力 → **5-5.5 heads tall with youthful proportions, shorter height but normal realistic anatomy, NOT chibi or deformed style**
- 大きめ（tall/elegant）を入力 → **7-8 heads tall with small head, long legs, elongated limbs for elegant mature style**
- 普通（balanced）を入力 → **exactly 6 heads tall, measure head size and make body exactly 5 more head lengths, balanced proportions**
- 指定なし（削除または空欄）→ 6頭身のデフォルト体型

**IMPORTANT: Even for "youthful/petite" option, maintain realistic human anatomy and proportions. This represents a younger or shorter character, NOT a stylized or deformed character. Keep facial features and body structure anatomically correct.**

**Use soft, muted color palette with low saturation around 40-60%. Apply pastel-like tones and gentle color gradations. Avoid harsh, vibrant colors - instead use subtle, desaturated hues with a dreamy, ethereal quality. Colors should have a milky, translucent feeling with plenty of white mixed in. Think watercolor-like softness rather than bold digital colors.**

The artistic style should embody the sophisticated digital painting techniques seen in games like Granblue Fantasy or Fate/Grand Order, with extremely detailed linework using thin, delicate lines that vary in weight to create depth and flow. The line art should be colored rather than pure black, using darker tones of the local colors for each area - brown tones for hair, deep blues or purples for dark clothing, creating a softer, more integrated look.

**The background must be completely black (#000000) to make the character stand out as a game asset or character portrait. No environmental elements, only the character against the black void.**

For the coloring technique, employ a refined cel-shading approach with two distinct shadow layers. **Shadows should be very subtle - first shadow only 8-10% darker than base color, second shadow 15-20% darker. Use warm gray or beige tones for shadows instead of pure darker colors. Blend shadows softly with gradient transitions.** The shadows should have a slight cool color shift towards blue-purple, adding atmospheric depth without looking muddy. Highlights should be painted in multiple layers - a soft, broad highlight for general luminosity, and sharp, bright highlights for materials like metal, eyes, and magical effects.

**Apply an overall atmospheric haze effect - as if viewing through soft focus or morning mist. Colors should blend into each other gently at the edges. Use opacity layers around 70-80% to create translucent, layered color effects.**

The character's face should feature the distinctive anime style with large, expressive eyes that take up about 25-30% of the face area. The eyes must be intricately detailed with at least 3-4 layers of iris coloring, creating depth and luminosity. **Eye colors should be desaturated and soft - even bright colors like blue or green should appear gentle and muted.** Include 2-3 carefully placed highlights - a primary bright highlight suggesting the main light source, and secondary, softer highlights for ambient reflections. The pupils should be slightly elongated vertically, giving an elegant, mystical appearance. Eyelashes should be delicately rendered with 10-15 individual lashes, avoiding thick, clumped looks.

Hair rendering is crucial - create flowing, voluminous hair divided into 10-20 main sections or chunks. Each section should flow naturally with clear directional movement. **Hair colors should be soft and muted - even vibrant colors like pink or blue should appear dusty and gentle, as if faded by sunlight.** Apply a two-tone shading system with the base shadow following the hair's form and a deeper shadow in the deepest recesses. Add angel ring highlights - broad, soft highlights that follow the hair's curvature, suggesting silk-like texture. The hair should have a sense of weightlessness, with some strands floating or flowing as if caught in a gentle breeze. Include subtle rim lighting on the edges to separate the hair from the black background.

The costume design should be elaborate and fantasy-themed, incorporating multiple materials and textures. **All clothing colors should be desaturated and soft - whites should be off-white or cream, blacks should be charcoal gray, bright colors should be dusty and muted.** Clothing should show realistic fabric behavior with medium-density folds that follow the body's form and movement. Different materials require different rendering approaches: leather should have sharp, bright highlights and deep shadows; fabric should have softer transitions; metal armor or accessories need strong contrast with near-white highlights and very dark shadows. Include intricate decorative elements like embroidery, gems, buckles, and magical symbols, each rendered with careful attention to how they catch and reflect light.

**Show the full body including legs and feet, with appropriate footwear that matches the outfit style - boots for knights, delicate shoes for dresses, traditional footwear for kimonos, etc.**

**Minimal to no magical effects or special elements. Focus solely on the character design itself without surrounding energy effects, auras, or magical circles. Any magical elements should be limited to the weapon or small details on the costume itself, not floating effects around the character. Keep the composition clean and simple - just the character against the black background without additional particle effects or energy swirls.**

The weapon or magical focus (staff, sword, tome, etc.) should be highly detailed with ornate decorations. Metal surfaces need strong contrast between highlights and shadows to convey their material properties. **Metals should appear aged or antiqued rather than bright chrome - use pearl, platinum, or tarnished gold tones.** Any gems or crystals should have internal reflections and refractions, suggesting transparency and depth. Magical weapons should have energy effects flowing along their surface or emanating from key points.

**Add a subtle rim light or outline glow around the character to ensure they pop from the black background, using soft pastel tones rather than bright neon colors.**

The overall composition should be dynamic yet balanced, with the character positioned centrally in a full-body standing pose. The pose should suggest both elegance and power - perhaps mid-action in casting a spell, or in a battle-ready stance that shows off the costume and weapon design from head to toe.

**Final color treatment: Apply a subtle color filter over the entire image to unify the palette - a very light overlay of cream, lavender, or pale blue to create cohesion. Reduce overall contrast slightly to maintain the soft, dreamy aesthetic. Think of the color palette of vintage illustrations or faded photographs - gentle, harmonious, and soothing to the eye.**

For final polish, apply subtle post-processing effects: minor color grading to unify the palette, and careful contrast adjustments to ensure the character pops from the black background while maintaining the soft color aesthetic. The rim lighting should be subtle but effective in creating separation.

The final image should convey a sense of premium quality suitable for high-end mobile game character art, with every element polished to perfection, creating a full-body character portrait that appears both powerful and appealing, mysterious yet approachable, maintaining the distinctive aesthetic that makes Japanese fantasy game art so recognizable and beloved worldwide.
